Aspose requires license.

Sirius already uses aspose and have the license, but as I understood, they do not prolong license, and therefore they stuck with the specific version.

pros
does not require external dependencies or unmanaged code.
we already have the license

cons
stuck to the specific version due to license not being prolonged
slow
feedback from sirius that quality of the generated pdf is not so good
